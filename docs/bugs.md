1. in the WORDLE game, the user is not able to see the error message when they enter a invalid word, the error message is too much on the top and is not even visible
you can place this error message on the right side of the guessing grid

2. not a bug but i think we increase the number of words in the contract.rs in the wordle game like 200-300 something, check on this like would it impact the speed of the smart contract and to much extend we can further increase it or not (probably to be done in the next wave now kay, right now more focus is on the polishing the user experience of the game man okay )
